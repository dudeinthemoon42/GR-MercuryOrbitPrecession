# GR Simulation of Mercury's orbital precession
A 3-D visualization of Mercury's orbit and it's precession as predicted by General Relativity using the Schwarzschild solution. This is computed by a numerical algorithm as calculated from the Schwarzschild metric. The math behind the algorithm involves a four-dimensionally expanded Taylor Series, and is worked out in Thomas A. Moore's 'A General Relativity Workbook' Chapter 11.
